Bug 1 : Program wasn't detecting the prompt with multiple spaces (Typo Bug)
Tried to fix it with text =''.join(text.split())

Bug: Used ''.join() instead of ' '.join()
- Empty string removed ALL spaces
- "ignore previous instructions" became "ignorepreviousinstructions"
- Patterns didn't match anymore

The fix: Add a SPACE between the quotes
- ' '.join() preserves single spaces between words
- Now patterns match correctly

Lesson learned:
- Tiny typos can break everything
- Always test after making changes
- Python syntax matters: '' vs ' ' is a huge difference 

**`.split()`** breaks text into words: `['ignore', 'previous', 'instructions']`

**`.join()`** puts them back together with whatever is between the quotes:
- `''.join()` → No separator → "ignorepreviousinstructions"
- `' '.join()` → Space separator → "ignore previous instructions"
